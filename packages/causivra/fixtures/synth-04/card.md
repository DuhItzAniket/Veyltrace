- **checkout**: checkout failed no trial, but some of its mandatory trials were untestable, and its verified score did not exceed the leader's.
- **frontend**: frontend failed no trial, but some of its mandatory trials were untestable, and its verified score did not exceed the leader's.

## Asks

- telemetry: all — no anomaly evidence in any source

## Next steps

- Collect the telemetry named in the asks. (PB-INCONC-01)

- Run the diagnosis again once the asks are answered. (PB-INCONC-01)
